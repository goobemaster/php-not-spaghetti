# Overview

PHP-Simple-Blog is a down to earth [free](#licence) **personal blogging web application**. It is **easy to deploy and configure**, and it comes bundled with an **administration panel** too. Start authoring in less than 5 minutes, and really **own what you write**.

The goal is to continuously extend the features of PHP-Simple-Blog without ever compromising **simplicity and ease of use**. If you are looking for a Content Management System, check out [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).

*It is written by a software engineer who is a prolific blogger himself:*

*"Although I prefer complex CMS systems even for blogging, I have to come to the conclusion that most people out there are often intimidated by them.*

*Alternative blogging systems are aplenty, but many has its quirks and "personality disorders". And by using free blogging sites comes with the risk of a closure, when you end up with a pile of backup files (best case) and a major headache.*

*I want to ensure that this project will never become an overkill, it won't overwhelm you, so you can concentrate on authoring and social interactions. All along without ever charging for it."*
